            const body = `Dear Ministry, 
                
                I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the recent instance of incorrect portrayal of sensitive information regarding a specific minority of this country. The dissemination of blasphemous animation on this specific media platform known as “SUDARSHAN NEWS”, on 22/10/2023, is unacceptable under the purview of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and article 19(2)(a) should be implemented on it . As a concerned citizen, I believe that it is essential to address such matters to uphold the integrity of our media and cultural values. Any minority group is also an equal part of this country and this must be kept in mind. 
                
                It has come to my attention that SUDARSHAN NEWS has been publishing and broadcasting information that is highly sensitive, mishandled and absolutely intolerable. This misrepresentation can have a severe impact on public perception and exacerbate existing tensions.
                
                The Masjid Nabwi located in Medina ( Saudi Arabia) is an extremely sacred place for the whole Muslim population. Showing it in an absurd way being blasted and subsequently “destroyed” by “missiles fired towards” is not only heights of stupidity but also an immature and desperate attempt to show how unwanted a minority community is in this country. Consequently, it can become a cause for unwanted upheavals. It is crucial to promote respect and tolerance for diverse religious beliefs in our society. 
                
                I believe that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the ethical standards and values upheld by our nation. By addressing these concerns, we can foster an environment that encourages responsible media practices and ensures the protection of religious sentiments.
                
                I kindly request the Ministry to initiate a thorough investigation into this instance and take appropriate actions to ensure that accurate and responsible reporting is maintained. I urge the Ministry to assess the content that violates these principles and take necessary steps to address this issue promptly and establish guidelines and regulations to prevent the dissemination of inappropriate or offensive content in the future.
                
                I appreciate your attention to these pressing matters and look forward to seeing effective actions taken to address them. Please keep me informed of the steps being taken to rectify these issues.
                
                Thank you for your time and consideration.
                Sincerely,
                 responsible citizen of India.`;
