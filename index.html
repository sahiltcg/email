const body = `Dear Chief Architect, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep concern about the proposed removal of Sunehri Masjid, a Grade-III Heritage building listed under Notification dated 01.10.2009 of GNCTD.
\n
Beyond its architectural significance, Sunehri Masjid holds profound importance in Islam and stands as a testament to our cultural and religious heritage. The mosque serves not only as a place of worship but also as a symbol of community, unity, and spiritual identity for many residents.
\n
While acknowledging the need for traffic engineering and sustainable mobility, it is crucial to approach decisions that involve the removal of a mosque with utmost sensitivity. The preservation of religious structures is vital not only for historical continuity but also for fostering a sense of belonging and identity among the diverse communities that call our city home.
\n
I kindly request a reconsideration of the proposal and the exploration of alternative solutions that can balance the imperatives of traffic management with the preservation of our cultural and religious heritage. Collaborative efforts between the NDMC, Delhi Traffic Police, and concerned citizens can lead to innovative solutions that address traffic challenges without compromising the sanctity and importance of religious structures like Sunehri Masjid.
\n
I trust your office will carefully consider these objections and suggestions, ensuring that any decision made reflects a commitment to preserving our city's heritage, including its cultural and religious landmarks.
\n
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a decision that upholds the values of both sustainable development and the importance of preserving our cultural and religious heritage.`;
